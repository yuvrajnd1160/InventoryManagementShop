Project Title
Inventory Management System using Java


 Project Description
This project is a **console-based Inventory Management System** developed using Java.  
It helps shop owners or users to manage product records such as **product ID, product name, quantity (in kg), and price per kg** efficiently using core Java concepts.

---

 Objective
To develop a Java-based inventory management system that:
- Stores multiple product details  
- Calculates total cost of products  
- Improves understanding of core Java programming  
- Demonstrates real-world use of arrays and user input handling  

---

 Technologies Used
- Java (Core Java)
- GitHub (Version Control & Submission)
- VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA
- Windows Operating System

---

 Key Features
- User-defined number of products
- Stores product ID, name, quantity, and price
- Uses arrays for data storage
- Accepts user input using `Scanner` class
- Calculates and displays product details clearly
- Simple, beginner-friendly, and menu-driven logic
- Suitable for small shop inventory management

Price per kg (in money): 50

--- Inventory Records ---
ID: 101, Name: sugar, Quantity: 50.0 kg, Price per kg: ?45.0, Total Value: ?2250.0
ID: 102, Name: peanuts, Quantity: 40.0 kg, Price per kg: ?140.0, Total Value: ?5600.0
ID: 103, Name: rice, Quantity: 100.0 kg, Price per kg: ?50.0, Total Value: ?5000.0

Enter Product ID to search: 101
Product Found: sugar, Quantity: 50.0 kg, Price per kg: ?45.0, Total Value: ?2250.0

Enter Product ID to sell: 101
Enter quantity sold (in kg): 25
Sale successful! Remaining stock: 25.0 kg, New Total Value: ?1125.0

Product with highest stock: rice (100.0 kg)

=== Code Execution Successful ===

 Future Scope
- Add database connectivity (MySQL)
- Create GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX
- Add product update and delete options
- Implement login system for admin/user
- Generate bill and total inventory value

---

 Learning Outcomes
- Clear understanding of arrays and loops
- Hands-on experience with `Scanner` class
- Improved problem-solving skills
- Better understanding of real-world Java applications

---

 Conclusion
This project helped in understanding **core Java concepts** such as arrays, loops, classes, and user input handling.  
It also provided practical exposure to **project structuring, GitHub usage, and documentation**, making it useful for academic as well as real-world learning.
